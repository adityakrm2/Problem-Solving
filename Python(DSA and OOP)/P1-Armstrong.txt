# A three digit number is said to be an “Armstrong number” if the
#     sum of the third power of its individual digits is equal to the number itself.
# Example: 371 is an Armstrong number as 371 = 3 3 + 7 3 + 1 3
#               407 is an Armstrong number as 407 = 4 3 + 0 3 + 7 3
# check whether a given three digit number is an Armstrong number.
